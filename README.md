# In_Virtual_Trials Simulator

A Streamlitâ€‘based web app that uses an LLM (OpenAI GPTâ€‘4o) to simulate preclinical mouse trials. Researchers enter molecular and biological parameters, and the system returns mechanistically grounded predictionsâ€”toxicity, mouse effects, temperature curves, pathway modulation, activity loss, immune profileâ€”and a clear **passâ€¯/â€¯failâ€¯/â€¯uncertain** outcome.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Intuitive UI**: Enter compound SMILES, dosing, mouse strain, immunostate, tumor model, etc.  
- **LLMâ€‘powered Simulation**: GPTâ€‘4o with a detailed system prompt for biologically realistic predictions.  
- **Seven Key Endpoints**:  
  1. Quantitative toxicity prediction  
  2. Mechanistic analysis  
  3. Behavioral & physiological changes  
  4. Body temperature curve  
  5. Pathway inhibition/activation  
  6. Activity loss metrics  
  7. Immune response profile  
- **Passâ€¯/â€¯Failâ€¯/â€¯Uncertain** trial outcome with clear rationale.  
- **Export JSON Report** of all predictions for downstream analysis.
